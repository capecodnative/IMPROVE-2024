"IMPAER","Processing Note","01/01/2017","First complete version of IMPROVE processing code. Data change - Updated reconstructed mass to use chloride instead of Cl for both CSN and Improve. Added carbon laser parameters to processing and FED delivery. Require a minimum of 3 carbon field blanks per month instead of 2. Now exclude BYIS from estimates of collocated precision. improve_absorption has been updated to obtain the HIPS calibration factors from the database rather than hard-coding. The calibration factors are now date range specific and lot specific and queries from the database. Carbon concentrations for totals (OC, EC, TC) are now calculated by summing the blank corrected totals. This makes the calculation the same as has been historically done in FED. The logic of determining carbon artifact for double filters is now the same as the one used in SWAP, the old system."
"IMPAER","Analysis Note","08/31/2017","Started delivery of IMPROVE semi-annual QA report"
"IMPAER","Calculation Note","01/01/2018","Sampling date: changed flow rate calculation to using universal flow constants for sites with V4 sampler controlled installed"
"IMPAER","Processing Note","01/01/2018","Artifact and MDL calculations for ions and carbon are now based on 95th percentile and median of sets of 50+ blanks. If field blank stats exist for a given year/month, they are taken directly from the database. Bug fix: sample dates for reconstructed mass (RCMC and RCMN) are now in UTC. Updated IMPROVE fractional uncertainty calculation method to use all selected years as a whole rather than by each year. improve_absorption() has been updated to accommodate the case that the filter doesn't have a matching LotId in HIPSCalibration table.Â Complete rework of XRF processing: improve_elements() now uses ArealDensity from the xrf.DeviceCounts table directly, calculates lot specific field blank statistics, and uses the same code for uncertainty and MDL as the other analyses. Blank processing for odd filter lots (such as those from the larger BYIS filters) is handled with a list of analogous lot ids, currently found in parameters.R. The old XRF processing pathway is available in improve_elements_pre_2018_10(). improve_calculate_all() will select the correct function based on the year and month of processing. Limited improve_monthly_parameters() to RT and CL modules. Calculations will not longer throw warnings about missing records from test and research sites. Added more error handling for queries returning no records. Updated improve_absorption to deal with lot-specific calibration. Pushed old method of XRF process from October 2018 back to January 2018. Add pieces to handle the XRF blank processing for larger BYIS filters of early 2018 months. Make further updates to handle the XRF blank processing for larger BYIS filters of early 2019 months. Reverted change in 2.4.6. New XRF processing is now only run for October 2018 and later. UN flags are now properly removed for the new XRF processing and for flow data. Fixed bug where a module would not be included in the gap filling code (improve_join_missing) if the start date was the first day of the sample month."
"IMPAER","Processing Note","01/01/2018","Standardized blank processing and MDL estimation for EDXRF, HIPS, gravimetric, IC and TOA analysis"
"IMPAER","Sampling Note","10/01/2018","Sampling date: PTFE filter manufacturer changed from PALL to MTL"
"IMPAER","Analysis Note","10/01/2018","Modified EDXRF analytical application by removing KBr secondary target to improve sensitivity for selected elements"
"IMPAER","Analysis Note","10/01/2018","Sampling date: Introduced MTL weighing chamber for gravimetric analysis"
"IMPAER","Sampling Note","01/01/2019","Deployed new sampler controller (V4 controller) including new Ebox with digital pressure transducers and internet connectivity throughout the network; This work was completed over the course of 2018-2019."
"IMPAER","Processing Note","01/01/2019","Updated HIPS processing to use dynamic MDLs based on field blank stats by lot. HIPS analytical MDL is stored in analysis.AqsParameters as optical depth with the parameter name: tau_633. We now fill missing values correctly for cases where the module to be filled started or ended within the processing month. No longer performing XRF blank correction for 37-mm filters such as at BYIS. we do not have enough field blanks for valid statistics and have decided to do this over choosing an analog lot to substitute. Derived parameters (S3 and nonsoil potassium) will now report negative values instead of NULL. Limited field blank search window to +/- 3 months. It was increased temporarily to deal with BYIS, but that is no longer needed because of the changes in 2.7.0. Updated carbon and ion uncertainty equation to use the 95th percentile instead of the standard deviation of field blanks. Bugfix for ions and carbon not using the new (2.10.0) calculation change. Fix to improve_monthly_parameters so that modules starting on the first of the month are not included in the previous month. We now allow HIPS processing to continue if field blank stats can be processed. Instead of an error, a warning will be thrown and filters from that lot will report fAbs but not uncertainty or MDL. Reconstructed mass query now specifies particle cut point to avoid including odd sites like DINO. Added a check for records with a valid status but no value. A warning with a list of filters is provided. Updated mass uncertainty and MDL calculations to make dynamic and consistent with other parameters. We now use the most severe status to determine the StatusId for composite values. Prior to this, Status for all composite values was NULL. When HIPS is missing a filter lot in the calibration table, instead of an error, a warning is given and processing will continue. The user will need to determine if this needs to be fixed. In improve_export_fed and improve_export_wide, any record with a null value and a non-terminal status will now be assigned the NS status. Updated field blank processing to search three months behind instead of just two. Fixed case where UN flagged filters would be added to HIPS (and possibly elements and flow) when they were not present in the analysis table. Added improve_resolve_missing to all primary calculations. This checks for any null values that have non-terminal status and sets the status to NS. This check already existed in improve_export_fed/wide, but this pushes the updated status into analysis.Results. Fixed bug in improve_export_fed/wide that was replacing UN status with NS. Updated RCMC, RCMN, coarse mass, and soil MDL from 0 to NA."
"IMPAER","Processing Note","01/01/2020","Updated calculation code to support dynamic analytical mdl. Composite parameters (soil, RCMN, RCMC) will now be null if any of the underlying parameters are null. If duplicate records are found in field blank processing, an error will be thrown. Added the max value threshold from the main improve_absorption code to the calculation of tau to process_improve_field_blanks_hips. This value is not likely to be reached in field blanks, so no change is expected. Extended field blank window to include 3 months forward beyond the current month (instead of just 2). Fixed error in fAbs uncertainty calculation. Fixed case where coarse mass values were not reported when one of the collocated modules had a terminal status. Added support for IMPROVE analysis flags across all analyses with flagging. Each parameter will now report a single status that is the most severe of status flags from filter, flow, and analysis. XRF and HIPS processing is now lot number specific as opposed to lot id specific. The LotId refers to both a lot number and a date range, but we want to be able to use lot statistics across time when the same lot number is reused. Field blank sets and stats are now broken into individual tables for each analysis type. Complete reworking of field blank processing structure and code to support the above changes. analysis.Sets now has a field called FBNotes which contains info on the FBSetId from each analysis. analysis.Sets.FieldBlankSetId will no longer be populated. Updated tests to accommodate new structure. Added min_samples as a parameter in get_improve_fb_set_wlot and get_improve_fb_set. This allows for processing field blank statistics when fewer field blanks are available than required by default. Note that this parameter is not exposed in improve_calculate_all. To process months with fewer field blanks than required, you must first run get_improve_fb_set[_wlot], specifying min_samples for each analysis that is short of field blanks. This will write the field blank set into the appropriate table that improve_calculate_all will use. Fixed a bug in which duplicates were introduced if there were differing analysis-level flags on the inputs to improve_soil and improve_knon."
"IMPAER","Processing Note","11/01/2020","XRF instruments moved from Jungerman Hall to 1560 Drew Ave"
"IMPAER","Processing Note","01/01/2021","New function improve_export_preliminary which can be used to generate a preliminary FED delivery file covering multiple months.
